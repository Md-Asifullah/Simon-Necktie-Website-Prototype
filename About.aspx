        <h1>About Simon Necktie</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            It's more than a necktie. It's the tie that goes with your school uniform. Your graduation cufflinks. When you got your dream job, you wore this tie. This is your wedding tie. For your first family portrait, you and your son donned identical ties. The tie you wore down the aisle to escort your daughter down. Simon Necktie began as a store selling themed ties (way back when). Our consumers began to request solid colors, stripes, and classic designs that they couldn't obtain anyplace else.</p>

<p>We increased our product selection, and our objective now is for Simon Necktie to be the first place you think of when you need a distinctive tie—for any event.We aren't simply a tie shop. We are in the business of selling memories.</p>

<p>BTW: Life is costly enough as it is, but our bonds aren't. We run our business effectively and make every penny count. That's great news for you since it means we can keep our costs affordable.
