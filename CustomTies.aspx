            Creating custom logo ties for your school or business is fast, easy and affordable with Simon Necktie.
</p>
<p>Our custom ties are made from polyester or silk. For orders less than 50 ties or those needed quickly, the custom ties are created via dye sublimation. This permanently dyes the design onto a pre-manufactured polyester necktie. These ties measure 3.25-inches wide and 57-inches long.</p>

<p>For silk or polyester ties in quantities of 50 or more, ties can be manufactured from scratch in the size and style of your choice. See timing and pricing below for additional details. Bow ties, children's ties, women's scarves and other products are available in these large quantities, too.</p>
